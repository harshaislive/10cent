## Meaningful Framework Questions (Contextual Memory Builders)

These questions are designed to bypass the "transactional" brain and tap into the "emotional/identity" brain. They categorize the user not by demographics, but by values.

### Question 1: The Recharge Archetype
**Question:** "If you had a completely free Saturday, what does 'recharging' actually look like for you?"
**Options:**
A. "High volume. Loud music, friends, and energy." (The Socialite)
B. "Comfort zone. Family time, good food, and home." (The Nester)
C. "Zero signal. Deep silence, nature, and solitude." (The 10% Persona)
**Why it works:** It forces them to visualize their ideal state. Option C subtly aligns them with the product before they even buy it.

### Question 2: The Asset Definition
**Question:** "Most assets sit in a bank account. Where do you want your legacy to live?"
**Options:**
A. "In the market." (Stocks, bonds, numbers.)
B. "In the moment." (Travel, experiences, fleeting memories.)
C. "In the earth." (A forest, a sanctuary, something that grows.)
**Why it works:** It reframes the "cost" of the membership as an investment in "legacy" rather than just "property".
