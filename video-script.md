## [0-5 seconds] HOOK
*(Visual: Split screen - stressed professional vs calm person in nature)*

**VOICEOVER:** What if 10% of your time could transform the other 90%?

## [5-15 seconds] PROBLEM
*(Visual: Fast-paced montage of city life, deadlines, phone notifications, exhaustion)*

**VOICEOVER:** You're building something meaningful. But you're running on empty.

Something we all knew instinctively, generations ago.

Something science now confirms we actually need.

*(Visual: Person stepping into wilderness, taking deep breath, transformation begins)*

**VOICEOVER:** Here's what successful people are discovering:

Nature isn't an escape. It's a return.

A return to how we're actually designed to function.

Just 10% in wild spaces. That's the math.

Not another wellness trend. Another retreat.

A practical strategy for better performance.
