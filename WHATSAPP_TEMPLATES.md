# The 10% Club: WhatsApp Communication Protocols

This document contains the approved copy for automated WhatsApp communications. The tone is **assertive, editorial, and minimalist**. We do not "sell"; we "invite" and "confirm". We use silence and space even in our text.

**Formatting Guide:**
*   `*Bold*` for emphasis on key concepts.
*   `_Italics_` for philosophical undertones.
*   `

` for intentional spacing.
