It feels like a beautifully distilled expression of the Beforest spirit—access over ownership, conscious over consumerist, grounding over escaping. And the name "10cent Club" is catchy, layered, and symbolic in all the right ways. Here's some feedback and ideas you might find useful:

### <a name="_10ecnfjcf9qj"></a>**The Product (Solid foundation)**
**"30 nights in the wilderness, per year – for ten years – at ₹15L"**

- Clear, bold, and with a hint of exclusivity.
- Clarify “inclusive of meals, experiences, and stays across Beforest landscapes” depending on what’s offered.
- Cap the number of memberships to add scarcity and value.
### <a name="_g2bhlg5auhs9"></a>**The Proposition**
### <a name="_d8xswhvhv5le"></a>**"1/10th of your life spent in the wilderness is all the luxury your mind needs"**:
- *"Rewild your calendar. One-tenth of your life in nature."*
- *"Not a second home. A second chance—to slow down, and reconnect."*
### <a name="_lyg06x190lco"></a>**The Brand (emotive & credible)**
**Beforest 10cent Club\
“Because time in nature gives the best returns.”**\
` `Perfect tie-in to the 4 Returns framework without being heavy-handed. Clean and memorable.

Some  alternate taglines depending on where we position it:

- *“A decade in the wild”*
- *“For those who value presence over possession.”*

### <a name="_y4pjxuwqugb3"></a>**A few thoughts to strengthen it further:**
**1. Target Persona**

- Young-ish urban professionals, 30-45, successful but seeking meaning.
- Maybe nature lovers who *aren’t* ready for ownership but want to start *belonging*.
- The kind of people who buy into wellness retreats but want something recurring and deeper.

**2. UX Layer**

- A beautiful digital dashboard or membership portal: track nights used, book stays, get invites to seasonal experiences, see your impact.
- Each member gets a small “tree ring” chronicle—photos, journal snippets, maybe even a digital herbarium of their journey over the years.

**3. Community Hooks**

- Maybe access to one curated annual gathering just for the 10cent members across all collectives. Call it “The Return.”
- Thoughtful touches like handwritten welcome notes, curated local gifts, or a printed annual “wilderness log.”
