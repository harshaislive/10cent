### <a name="_f790s9qxo7m2"></a>**Core Campaign Line (unifying thread)**
**“10% of your life spent with nature restores 100% of your nature.”**\
` `Secondary line: *“Places that secure your peace of mind—and the planet’s future.”*

We'll treat this as your anchor line—a mantra that sits across all visuals, while the campaign themes change.

### <a name="_ioxjyz7mlsuy"></a>**Campaign Series – Visual Concepts**
#### <a name="_yvvmt5g3cscw"></a>**Campaign 1: “The Meeting One”**
**Line**:

*You have 27 meetings in the next 3 months. Is any of them with nature?*\
` `**Visual**:

- A minimalist calendar filled with blocks. One empty square stands out, nestled with a tiny tree silhouette or a Beforest marker.
- Or: split screen—one side, a Zoom screen with 12 squares; other side, mist rising in a forest with no faces, just presence.

#### <a name="_yo22ho3mfens"></a>**Campaign 2: “The Sleep One”**
**Line**:

*You spend 25% of your life sleeping. 10% in nature is all you need to open your eyes.*\
` `**Visual**:

- A clean typographic visual mimicking a sleep tracker, with a forest path cutting through the circular graph.
- Or: a sleeping figure in nature—hammock under trees, soft light peeking in.
-----
#### <a name="_p3vl0c31rw5r"></a>**Campaign 3: “The Investment One”**
**Line**:

*Like every good portfolio, 10% of your life should be in a long-term investment.*\
` `**Visual**:

- A pie chart mimicking a wealth portfolio. One section labeled: “Wilderness. Yield: Peace.”
- Or: juxtapose city skyline on one side, forest on the other, with the “10%” slice visually cutting across both.

### <a name="_8433xr97etb"></a>**Design Approach for Campaigns**
**Overlay Elements**:

- Grainy textures, leaf shadows, faint tree ring motif in the background
- Quiet animations or stills for digital media—slow fog, fluttering leaves, a soft calendar tick
