**Proposed Time-Share Model -** We are proposing a model similar to Club Mahindra, where: Consumers purchase a fixed number of room-nights (e.g., annually or cumulatively) for a lump-sum payment valid over 10 years. These room-nights can be availed at multiple properties under your brand, subject to availability. The properties may be owned or leased, and located across various states.

**ANSWERS**

-----
**1. Regulatory Classification & Permissions - (a)** What licenses/registrations are needed to operate such properties? **(b)** Should the location be registered as a resort, guesthouse, or homestay? **(c)** Does the classification vary by state-specific tourism policies or follow a central framework (e.g., Ministry of Tourism)?                                                                                                                                                        .

1. **Licenses and Registrations needed to operate:**
- Trade License from Municipal corporation or local authority which is required for all commercial establishments. 
- Hotel/Boarding License required for public lodging. 
- Tourist Arrival Reporting, foreign guest details must be filed via Form C under Foreigners’ Report rules in many states.
- Fire Safety NOC from the State fire department based on occupancy and built up area. 
- Health Trade License required for maintenance of health standards in guest facilities. 
- FSSAI License required for serving food and beverages. 
- GST Registration compulsory (if turnover is over 20 lakhs) (shall differ from state to state).
- Guest‑register, billing records and local compliance for upkeep of records, bill books, guest registers, signage are mandatory under respective state and central guidelines
- Music and public performance license required if music is played in public areas. 
- Bar/NOC for alcohol required if serving alcoholic beverages. 
- Any other state specific registration, as applicable
1. **Registration of location:** 
- Depending on size and configuration, properties must be registered either as Resorts/Hotels or as Homestay / B&B units under the respective state tourism authority.
- Homestay/B&B classification: in states like Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala, Himachal you must register each unit, pay the applicable fees and comply with facility checklists, local NOC, police verification and inspections. 
- Guesthouses are smaller commercial establishments which require fewer licenses and registrations whereas Homestay requires the least amount of registrations and residence is in the spare and guestrooms of the owners residence. 
- Resort/hotel registration: for branded multi‑room properties, state tourism departments issue “Star Classification” similar to central standards administered by state authorities (e.g. UP Tourism’s star classification system). A location can be registered as a resort when it is a comparatively large establishment and it would require a larger number of licenses and permits.
- For the model proposed in the above scenario the establishment would fall under the category of a Resort/Hotel depending on the amenities that are sought to be provided. 
1. **State Specific tourism policy/Central tourism policy:** 
- **Central Regulatory Regime:** In India, there is no dedicated federal “timeshare law” analogous to foreign jurisdictions. Instead, timeshare operations are governed by a combination of property laws (Transfer of Property Act, Rent Control, state Real Estate Acts), contract law, and tourism licensing rules enforced by the Ministry of Tourism and state tourism departments. If your model involves deeded or right‑to‑use ownership, that will trigger real‑estate and conveyancing regulations; leasehold arrangements might require compliance with land‑use and lease control statutes; lump‑sum payment for future room‑nights constitutes a right‑to‑use contract, which needs careful drafting to avoid pitfalls of mis‑selling or non‑fulfilment.
- **State Tourism Regulation & Licensing:** Each Indian state has its own tourism policy and homestay / resort classification regime. States typically regulate small accommodation (homestays, B&Bs) through registration and classification programmes. Larger resorts or branded properties may require licensing as Hotels or Resorts, often involving classification into star categories under state tourism laws consistent with Ministry of Tourism norms.
- Both tourism policies will apply but the state norms and policies will take precedence when it comes to licenses and registrations. Central policies are mainly used in accordance with the amenities provided and for establishing the credibility of the establishment. 

**2. Land Use Conversion (Most important query) - (a)** Does the land on which the guest houses are built need to be converted to commercial/resort use? And **(b)** Is land use governed state-wise (as per local land revenue or urban planning acts), or does any central regulation apply to your model?                                  .

1. Yes, land on which guesthouses are constructed typically requires conversion from agricultural/residential to commercial, tourism, or hospitality use, depending on the land’s original classification. The precise classification depends on the state-specific master plan/zoning regulations and local development control rules.

   Time-share models, even though unique in commercial structure, still involve short-term accommodation services for consideration, which courts and authorities have historically interpreted as “commercial” use or “hospitality/tourism” use, depending on the state's planning regulations. As such, guesthouses generally do not fall under “residential” or “agricultural” use, and require express land use permission.

   Land use is generally covered by the state land revenue department under the state land revenue acts. They govern the land use conversion, building and zoning permission, tourism and land classifications, and environmental zones and buffer zones.  

1. **State-Wise Land Use Laws: Decentralised Framework**
   1. **Land Use is Primarily a State Subject**
- Land and land use regulation in India is governed under the **State List (Entry 18)** of the Constitution. Consequently, **there is no single central legislation that uniformly governs land use conversions across India**. Instead, the relevant rules and procedures are framed and enforced at the **state and local (municipal or panchayat) levels**.
  1. **Governing Legal Framework -** Each state has its own laws such as:
- Maharashtra**:** Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 (MRTP Act)
- Karnataka: Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act, 1961

- Tamil Nadu: Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971

- Goa: Goa Town and Country Planning Act, 1974

- Himachal Pradesh: Himachal Pradesh Town and Country Planning Act, 1977

- Uttarakhand/Uttar Pradesh: Uttar Pradesh Urban Planning and Development Act, 1973 (applicable to urban areas)

- Rajasthan: Rajasthan Urban Improvement Act, 1959

Additionally, local master plans/zonal regulations, issued by Urban Development Authorities or Local Planning Authorities, will specify permitted land uses (e.g., residential, commercial, recreational, tourism, etc.). Where guesthouses or resort accommodations are not permitted under the current zoning, a land use conversion (change of land use or “CLU”) approval is mandatory.

1. **Land Revenue Laws and Agricultural Land Conversion**
- In most states, agricultural land cannot be used for any non-agricultural purpose without conversion under the respective Land Revenue Act. 
- Failure to obtain proper conversion attracts penalties and potential demolition orders, in addition to making the land ineligible for commercial operations (including power, water, and GST registration in many cases).

**3. If a particular property/location underperforms or fails to attract guests, Can we replace, remove, or sell the location at management’s discretion? Can such a change in offering be contractually made subject to terms and conditions agreed upon by consumers?                                                                   .**

1. **Rights of Management in Respect of Property**
- #### <a name="_heading=h.4zno262v5737"></a>**Properties Owned by the Company**
  Where the company owns the underlying property (either owned completely or on a lease with full rights of development and transfer), the management has significant autonomy to deal with such assets. Subject to applicable municipal, zoning, and environmental restrictions, the company can choose to: (i) Replace or Re-purpose the asset (e.g., convert from hospitality use to commercial/residential); (ii) Sell the asset to a third party (subject to nature of the ownership or terms of the agreement concerning the land and no contractual restrictions such as charges, mortgages, or covenants running with the land); or (iii) Remove the asset from the pool of available properties under the time-share model.

  There is no legal impediment to the company discontinuing use of such properties in the time-share program, so long as the consumers’ entitlements are not violated. To ensure this, the consumer contract must include appropriate disclaimers and clauses allowing for rotation, replacement, or retirement of specific locations without consumer consent.
- #### <a name="_heading=h.d043iegkc1hc"></a>**Properties Leased by the Company**
  If the property is leased, the company’s flexibility will be subject to the terms of the lease deed. The following considerations include: 

1. Exit and Termination Clauses: The lease must confer termination rights to the lessee (i.e., the company) or allow for mutual termination without onerous penalties;
1. Permitted Use Clauses: If the lease restricts the use to hospitality or time-share purposes only, the company cannot repurpose the asset without landlord consent; 
1. Assignment/Sub-Lease Restrictions: The ability to assign or sublet the lease interest to another operator or buyer may be restricted.
1. For leased properties, it is crucial that lease agreements are negotiated to retain maximum commercial flexibility, including clear rights to terminate, substitute, or exit based on underperformance or strategic shift.
1. ` `**Rights and Expectations of Consumers under the Time-Share Model**
   1. **Nature of Consumer Rights -** Under such a time-share model (akin to Club Mahindra), the consumer typically does not acquire any ownership or real estate interest in the properties. Instead, they purchase a contractual right to access a certain number of room-nights over a defined period. These rights are usually subject to terms including: Availability of rooms at chosen properties (subject to blackout dates, seasonal restrictions); Dynamic rotation of properties in the network; and/or No fixed entitlement to specific properties or locations. Accordingly, the company may reserve the right (contractually) to add or remove properties from the network, relocate operational focus, or decommission underperforming locations, provided this does not materially reduce the overall access or value promised under the agreement.
   1. **Recommended Clauses and Disclaimers in Consumer Agreement -** To preserve operational flexibility and limit legal risk, the following should be explicitly captured in the consumer agreement:
- **Network Variability Clause**: Clearly state that the list of participating properties is dynamic and subject to periodic change at management discretion.

- **No Right to Specific Property**: Most Indian time-share models (like Club Mahindra, Sterling, etc.) are structured as contractual service arrangements, not real estate ownership. Clarify that consumers are not purchasing the right to own the property but to access or stay at a particular property and rather the right to avail rooms from the available network.

- **Substitution and Rotation Clause**: Reserve rights to substitute or remove properties and to replace them with properties of equal or better quality/value.
- **Permissibility of Changing Offerings via T&Cs**:** Courts in India generally uphold changes to service offerings if the right to do so was clearly communicated and accepted by the consumer as part of the contract. Therefore, yes, you may: (i) Reserve the right to add, remove, replace, or reallocate properties within the brand network; (ii) Specify that such changes will not amount to breach, provided alternative properties of similar value/experience are available; 
- **Force Majeure and Strategic Realignment**: Include a clause allowing property rotation due to commercial, legal, environmental, or strategic considerations.
- **Non-Liability Clause**: It is important to include terms that state that such changes in the property network shall not constitute a deficiency of service, breach of contract, provided the consumer retains access to room-nights across the brand network.

These clauses must be prominently disclosed (ideally in both the contract and marketing materials) to avoid allegations of misrepresentation under consumer protection laws.

**4. Advertising Future Locations -** If you currently have 2 operational properties and plan to add 4 more in 2 years, are you allowed to: Advertise or pre-sell the 6-location offering today? And what are the disclosure requirements, disclaimers, or legal caveats to include to avoid misrepresentation?                     .

1. **Considerations pertaining to advertisement of future properties -** 

   The essential legal feature of such schemes is that they are treated as "service contracts", involving future service delivery (i.e., accommodation) in return for advance lump-sum consideration. Unlike fractional ownership or real estate investment models, time-share models typically do not convey any proprietary interest in the underlying property, which distinguishes them from being classified as a real estate offering under RERA in most cases.

   One may advertise and offer packages that refer to both existing and upcoming locations, provided that the communication is factually accurate, non-misleading, and includes appropriate caveats about the status of under-development or proposed properties. There is no blanket restriction under Indian law on advertising future services, but transparency is critical to avoid running afoul of consumer protection provisions.

   However, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 (CPA) will squarely apply, particularly the provisions relating to unfair trade practices, misleading advertisements, and product liability for deficiency in promised services. The Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020 and Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) Code also require that all representations made in advertisements, including implied claims, be capable of substantiation at the time they are made. If the offering involves collection of advance payments or bookings for properties that are yet to become operational, you must avoid giving the impression that those properties are immediately available. Otherwise, you risk contravening Section 2(47) and Section 2(28) of the CPA dealing with unfair trade practices and misleading advertisements.

1. **The establishment can advertise its future ventures but with several restrictions and disclosures like:**
- It needs to properly indicate which properties are currently operational and which properties are proposed or planned. 
- The availability of future locations cannot be guaranteed unless with the presence of bidding arrangements. 
- The establishment may be liable to compensate or refund the expenses incurred by parties with reference to the proposed or future properties in case of any default or disputes. 
- Indicating whether customers have any remedy (e.g., refund or alternative accommodation) if a proposed property is not delivered within the anticipated timeline.
- Including a clear disclaimer that the offering does not grant any ownership, leasehold, or tenancy rights in any specific property.
- If any new properties are subject to regulatory, municipal, or environmental approvals, this must be disclosed.
- Disclosure for the availability of property and the details of the same. 
- Disclosure making to property subject to availability so as to not provide a guarantee. 
- Disclosure of the proposed construction and approximate deadlines for the same. 

**5. Leased Properties & Risks - (a)** Can leased properties be included as valid time-share offerings?; **(b)** If the lessor exits the lease or sells the property: (i) What consumer rights and remedies apply? (ii) How can the business protect access continuity or shift guests to alternate locations?                                           .
1. ### <a name="_heading=h.ouqxj31x5uq7"></a>**Inclusion of Leased Properties in Time-Share Schemes -** Yes, leased properties can be legally included in a time-share model in India, provided the lease agreements expressly permit such commercial use and sub-licensing or licensing of the premises to third parties (i.e., time-share consumers). It is necessary to have contractual clarity with the lessor, ensuring that the lease deed grants the lessee (i.e., the time-share operator) the right to commercially exploit the premises in this manner. The lease should ideally cover the entire proposed duration of the consumer offering (e.g., 10 years), or at least provide renewal rights that match or exceed the time-share term. Moreover, the consumer-facing contracts and marketing communications must disclose whether the property is owned or leased, and clarify that continued access is subject to the validity of the underlying lease.
1. ### <a name="_heading=h.75hidhmqhtni"></a>**Risks from Lessor’s Exit or Sale of Leased Property -** If the lessor exits the lease prematurely, refuses renewal, or sells the leased property to a third party who does not wish to honour the time-share arrangement, it poses significant risks to continuity of consumer access. Indian law recognizes the principle of "*nemo dat quod non habet*" meaning, one cannot grant rights greater than what one holds. Therefore, if the lessee’s interest is extinguished, so is the consumer’s derived interest. Unless the lease has been registered and explicitly binds successors-in-interest, a purchaser of the leased property may not be bound to honour existing arrangements with time-share customers.
   1. ### <a name="_heading=h.p304g6blvmfh"></a>**Consumer Rights and Remedies -** In such cases, consumer remedies would typically arise under:
- ### <a name="_heading=h.9330kung4scu"></a>The Consumer Protection Act, 2019 - Consumers may file complaints for deficiency in service or unfair trade practices, especially if the risk of discontinuity was not disclosed at the time of contract. If a leased property becomes unavailable due to lease termination or sale, consumers can claim refunds or compensation under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 for deficiency in service or unfair trade practices (Section 2(11), 2(47), and 17).
- ### <a name="_heading=h.4e0fn1bzr15i"></a>The Indian Contract Act, 1872 - If the service provider fails to deliver contracted room-nights due to lease termination, it could be considered a breach of contract, entitling consumers to seek damages or refund.
- ### <a name="_heading=h.s58urqvvroom"></a>The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA) - While RERA applies mostly to real estate projects, some states have interpreted time-share models that involve construction as falling within RERA’s ambit, depending on the structure.
  1. ### <a name="_heading=h.64iceiwxxzlg"></a>**Risk Mitigation and Operational Safeguards -** To mitigate legal and reputational risk and ensure business continuity, the following legal and operational protections should be adopted:
- ### <a name="_heading=h.k40y1im8x9q9"></a>Draft Robust Lease Agreements - Inclusion of clauses such as ensuring lease agreements contain clear provisions permitting the lessee to license the property to time-share members and  include clauses enabling the operator to match any third-party offer or purchase the property upon expiry or termination of the lease and provision of minimum lock-in periods in order to seek longer lock-in periods aligned with time-share consumer contract terms and ensuring leases are registered and drafted to bind successors and assigns of the lessor.
- ### <a name="_heading=h.lyhtf77l7vnz"></a>Disclosure and Contractual Clarity with Consumers - Disclose in all consumer contracts whether the property is leased and insert clauses indicating that availability at any specific location is subject to the validity of underlying arrangements and allowing flexibility to redeem room-nights at alternate properties in case of unavailability.
- ### <a name="_heading=h.9hgzc9ydup9n"></a>Maintain Alternate Inventory- Maintaining a reserve pool of comparable properties to which guests can be shifted in case of unforeseen lease termination and considering entering into backup lease/license arrangements or MOU-based affiliations with partner properties to plug availability gaps.

<a name="_heading=h.ouz3ghws399p"></a>**6. Partial Sale of Large Property -** If a 50-acre resort property is being run under this model and the company wishes to: **(a)** Sell off 5 plots (2 acres each), reducing overall land by 20%, can this be legally done? **(b)** Can the new plot buyers be granted access rights to common facilities (clubhouse etc) in the remaining 40 acres? **(c)** Are there any restrictions or planning approvals required for such arrangements? .                                                                                        

1. **Permissibility of Sale of Part of the Property** - Yes, sale of 2-acre plots from a 50-acre resort is legally permissible subject to the local zoning laws allow subdivision and necessary approvals are obtained under state planning laws such as the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 or Karnataka TCP Act, 1961, provided the following are in place: 
   1. Clear Title and Segregation: The 2-acre plots must be clearly demarcated and legally severable. If the land is held as a single parcel in revenue or municipal records, prior subdivision approval may be required from the relevant local authority.
   1. Conversion of Land Use: If the property is classified as agricultural land, prior conversion to non-agricultural/resort use must be obtained under respective State land laws (e.g., Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964 or Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966).
   1. Local Development Control Regulations (DCR): Depending on the State and local municipal authority, a layout approval, plotting plan, or NOC may be required for selling parts of a larger parcel. Compliance with Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and open space norms must be ensured.
1. **Grant of Access Rights to Common Facilities** - Yes, it is legally permissible to grant rights of access to common facilities (such as clubhouses, pools, internal roads) in the remaining 40 acres to purchasers of the 2-acre plots, subject to:
   1. Legal Instrumentation: These rights must be documented clearly through: Easement agreements; License agreements; Declarations under the Apartment Ownership Act (if applicable); or A separate deed of covenant outlining the nature of rights, maintenance obligations, and fees.
   1. Access to common facilities by new buyers can be granted through a Facility Use Agreement or Easement under the Indian Easements Act, 1882. The company must retain control of amenities to avoid shared ownership issues. 
   1. Maintenance and Liability: The operational structure for maintaining these common facilities (through an owners’ association, resort operator, or a management company) must be clearly articulated to avoid future disputes and ensure enforceability.
   1. Consumer Expectations: If such facilities are marketed as part of the sale, failure to provide unfettered access can trigger liability under consumer protection laws and RERA (if applicable).
1. **Planning Approvals and Legal Restrictions** - Yes, several regulatory and planning approvals may be required before proceeding with the sale and granting shared access:
   1. Regional Planning Authority Approvals: Any subdivision of land for sale and subsequent construction may require layout approvals under the Town and Country Planning Act applicable in that State.
   1. Environmental and Coastal Regulations: If the property is located in an ecologically sensitive zone (e.g., forest-adjacent or coastal), clearances under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 or CRZ Notification, 2011 may be required.
   1. RERA Implications: If the plots are being sold with a promise of future construction, or if common facilities are part of the offering, the project may fall within the ambit of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 and require registration.
   1. State-Specific Prohibitions: Certain States (like Himachal Pradesh or Uttarakhand) impose restrictions on the sale of land to non-agriculturists or non-residents. These must be factored into buyer eligibility and transaction structure.
   1. Planning and layout approvals from local authorities are mandatory before subdivision. Consumer rights under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 must be safeguarded if the time-share model is affected.
