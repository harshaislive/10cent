## Purpose of These Questions

These reflection questions were designed to:

1. **Create Self-Awareness**: Help visitors recognize their disconnection from nature
2. **Establish Need**: Highlight the gap between their current state and natural living
3. **Offer Solution**: Position "30 nights a year" as the answer to their nature deficit
4. **Qualify Leads**: Identify visitors who are ready for a wilderness-based solution

Each question follows a pattern where users select their current relationship with nature, and receive personalized insights that lead toward the same conclusion: 30 nights in nature annually (10% of the year) can restore their connection to the natural world.
